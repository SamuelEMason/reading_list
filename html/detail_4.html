    Description: This website is a basic prototype for an app that allows you to save data about your reading materials
                all in one place. You can make a reading list, explore new reading material, and eventually the site
                will have other interactive, community based features.

                With the resurgence of neural networks in the 2010s, deep learning has become essential 
                for machine learning practitioners and even many software engineers. This book provides a 
                comprehensive introduction for data scientists and software engineers with machine learning experience.<br /><br />
                You'll start with deep learning basics and move quickly to the details of important advanced architectures, 
                implementing everything from scratch along the way.

                Author Seth Weidman shows you how neural networks work using a first principles approach. You'll learn how 
                to apply multilayer neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks from the ground up. <br /><br />

                With a thorough understanding of how neural networks work mathematically, computationally, and conceptually, 
                you'll be set up for success on all future deep learning projects.
